"""
When our code starts to get big, it'shortcut time that use modules.
- Create other file.py and put all functions inside.
- When I want to use any function, i need import
Ex ==> import file.py
Ex ==> from file.py import function_name

When our code starts to too far big, it'shortcut time that use packages
- When I have many functions in one module, the problem come back.
- Then, I can do several packages
Ex ==> commands {
    Numbers: Functions...
    Strings: Functions...
    Colors: Functions...
    etc.
}

- When I want to use any function according my project, I need import
Ex ==>  import commands
Ex ==> From commands import Numbers
