Decide for me
# Goal: Your program should allow the user to a question and your program should show on the screen that is thinking... for a few seconds, and then your program should respond to the user, within 10 possibilities that you have given it. Then you should ask the user if he wants to make a new question. If it answers yes, allow the user to ask a new question, otherwise, terminate the program.
